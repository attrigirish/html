		CARACAS, Venezuela â€“  A police helicopter fired on Venezuela's Supreme Court and Interior Ministry in what President <a href="#">Nicolas Maduro</a> said was a thwarted "terrorist attack" aimed at ousting him from power.

		The confusing exchange, which is bound to ratchet up tensions in a country already paralyzed by months of deadly <a href="#">anti-government</a> protests, took place as Maduro was speaking live on state television Tuesday. He later said the helicopter had fired on the pro-government court with grenades, one of which didn't go off, helping avoid any loss of life.
